# ðŸ”¤ Translations

We aim to remove all language barriers from Win11React. We use Crowdin to translate the website and files to make it more accessible to all.

If you wish to help please visit our Crowdin [page](http://translate.win11react.com/)

Some parts of the website may not be available for translation on Crowdin. The Translation component should be added first.
